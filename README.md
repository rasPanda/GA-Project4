### General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive

#Project 4: Listing

![Homepage](ReadMeImages/WelcomePage.png)

## The Overview:

This was my final project at General Assembly, and I had the flexibility to build any kind web project. The main brief was for it to be a full stack app with a frontend consuming a backend API.

The backend needed to be a Python Flask API, and using this Flask REST Framework to serve my data from a Postgres database. This backend was then to be consumed using a frontend client built with React.

Being inspired by a real-life need for a purchase-tracking app (by my wonderful wife!), I decided to create Listing. This web-app allows you to create individual lists, and add products to them. I built a custom web-scraper which allows the user to simply provide the product page URL and it will scrape data from the pages' meta tags to improve the UX. Finally, the app also links to the product pages when the user is ready to purchase, and will track whether the purchase has been made.

We had the choice of working in groups for this project. However due to the personal nature of the design, and wanting to challenge myself, I opted to work solo on this.

### The Brief

We were given the below brief:

You must:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Flask API** using a Flask REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.


Necessary deliverables are:

* A **working app** hosted on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories/wireframes** â€“ sketches of major views / interfaces in your application, if applicable
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
